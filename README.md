# Babamorphosis
Custom level pack for Baba Is You. Sequel of Babasynthesis.

Babasynthesis focused on the editor-exclusive words. Though PHANTOM and LOCKED were mostly untouched since they are relatively new words. This pack, as the sequel, will utilize the mechanics not well explored by Babasynthesis.

Babasynthesis is Map-styled, and Babamorphosis is Meta-styled. The latter contains around half the amount of levels of the former, but the levels in this pack are in general much harder. Being Meta-styled, it is also highly linear, so I included 3 challenge levels for you to refresh your mind if you get stuck on the main route.

Due to the pack's high difficulty, it is highly recommended that players complete at least the true ending of Baba Is You and the tutorial section of Babasynthesis before attempting this pack.

To play it: Download Babamorphosis_vx.x.x.zip from the releases. Unzip it inside the Worlds folder of your Baba Is You local files. Currently you have to be in beta to be able to play custom level packs.

Feel free to share this level pack if you find it fun. Though you should not modify and redistribute it without notifying me.
